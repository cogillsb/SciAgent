# Northern Blot Protocol

## Materials Required

### Reagents
- RNA samples
- Formaldehyde (37%)
- Formamide
- MOPS buffer (10X)
- Agarose
- Ethidium bromide
- Loading dye
- RNA size markers
- SSC buffer (20X)
- Hybridization buffer
- Labeled probe
- Washing buffers
- Detection reagents (depends on labeling method)

### Equipment
- Electrophoresis apparatus
- Power supply
- UV transilluminator
- Nylon membrane
- Filter paper
- Paper towels
- Glass plates
- Hybridization oven
- Plastic wrap
- X-ray film (if using radioactive probes)

## Procedure

### 1. Sample Preparation
1. Mix RNA samples with sample buffer:
   - 50% formamide
   - 6% formaldehyde
   - 1X MOPS buffer
2. Heat samples at 65°C for 15 minutes
3. Chill immediately on ice
4. Add loading dye

### 2. Gel Preparation
1. Prepare 1% agarose gel in 1X MOPS buffer containing:
   - 1% agarose
   - 6% formaldehyde
   - 1X MOPS buffer
2. Allow gel to solidify in fume hood
3. Pre-run gel for 30 minutes at 5V/cm in 1X MOPS buffer

### 3. Electrophoresis
1. Load samples and markers
2. Run gel at 5V/cm until loading dye reaches 2/3 of gel length
3. Visualize RNA using UV light to confirm quality
4. Document gel image

### 4. Transfer Setup
1. Rinse gel in DEPC-treated water
2. Soak gel in 20X SSC for 15 minutes
3. Set up transfer stack from bottom to top:
   - Stack of paper towels (5-8 cm)
   - 3 pieces of filter paper
   - Nylon membrane (pre-wet in 20X SSC)
   - Gel (wells facing down)
   - 3 pieces of filter paper
   - Long filter paper wick
   - Container with 20X SSC
4. Place glass plate on top
5. Add weight (~500g)

### 5. Transfer
1. Allow transfer to proceed overnight (12-16 hours)
2. Mark wells on membrane before disassembly
3. Rinse membrane briefly in 2X SSC
4. Cross-link RNA to membrane using UV crosslinker or bake at 80°C for 2 hours

### 6. Hybridization
1. Pre-hybridize membrane in hybridization buffer for 2-4 hours at 42°C
2. Add labeled probe to fresh hybridization buffer
3. Hybridize overnight at 42°C with gentle rotation

### 7. Washing
1. Wash membrane in decreasing concentrations of SSC buffer:
   - 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, 15 minutes (2x)
   - 0.2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42°C, 15 minutes (2x)
   - 0.1X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42°C, 15 minutes (if needed)

### 8. Detection
1. Follow appropriate detection protocol based on probe labeling method:
   - For radioactive probes: expose to X-ray film
   - For non-radioactive probes: follow manufacturer's protocol

### Critical Parameters
- Maintain RNase-free conditions throughout
- Ensure RNA samples are intact before starting
- Monitor temperature during hybridization
- Optimize washing stringency based on probe specificity

### Troubleshooting

#### No Signal
- Check RNA quality
- Verify probe labeling efficiency
- Increase probe concentration
- Decrease washing stringency

#### High Background
- Increase washing stringency
- Reduce probe concentration
- Extend pre-hybridization time
- Check blocking efficiency

#### Smeared Bands
- Check RNA degradation
- Reduce voltage during electrophoresis
- Ensure proper denaturation conditions

## Notes
- All solutions should be prepared with DEPC-treated water
- Wear gloves and use RNase-free materials
- Store membranes properly if multiple probing is planned
- Document all parameters for reproducibility
