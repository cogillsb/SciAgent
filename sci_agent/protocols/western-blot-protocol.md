# Western Blot Protocol

## Materials Required

### Reagents
- Protein samples
- Loading buffer (Laemmli buffer with β-mercaptoethanol)
- Molecular weight marker
- Running buffer (1X TGS)
- Transfer buffer
- Blocking solution (5% non-fat milk or BSA in TBST)
- Primary antibody
- Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated)
- ECL substrate
- TBST (TBS + 0.1% Tween-20)
- Ponceau S (optional)

### Equipment
- SDS-PAGE apparatus
- Power supply
- Transfer apparatus
- PVDF or nitrocellulose membrane
- Filter paper
- Sponges/fiber pads
- Rocking platform
- Image acquisition system

## Procedure

### 1. Sample Preparation
1. Determine protein concentration using Bradford or BCA assay
2. Dilute samples to equal concentrations
3. Add Laemmli buffer (4:1 sample:buffer ratio)
4. Heat samples at 95°C for 5 minutes
5. Briefly centrifuge samples

### 2. Gel Electrophoresis
1. Prepare SDS-PAGE gel (percentage based on protein size)
2. Load samples and molecular weight marker
3. Run at 80V through stacking gel
4. Increase to 120V through resolving gel
5. Run until dye front reaches bottom of gel

### 3. Transfer
1. Equilibrate gel in transfer buffer for 5 minutes
2. Activate PVDF membrane in methanol (skip if using nitrocellulose)
3. Assemble transfer sandwich:
   - Black side of cassette
   - Sponge
   - Filter paper
   - Gel
   - Membrane
   - Filter paper
   - Sponge
   - Red side of cassette
4. Transfer at 100V for 1 hour or 30V overnight at 4°C

### 4. Blocking and Antibody Incubation
1. Block membrane in blocking solution for 1 hour at room temperature
2. Incubate with primary antibody (diluted in blocking solution) overnight at 4°C
3. Wash 3x with TBST, 5 minutes each
4. Incubate with secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature
5. Wash 3x with TBST, 5 minutes each

### 5. Detection
1. Prepare ECL substrate according to manufacturer's instructions
2. Add substrate to membrane and incubate for 1-5 minutes
3. Image membrane using appropriate detection system

## Notes

- Always use fresh transfer buffer
- Avoid air bubbles when assembling transfer sandwich
- Optimize blocking conditions and antibody dilutions
- Include appropriate controls
- Handle ECL substrate in reduced light conditions

## Troubleshooting

### No Signal
- Check transfer efficiency with Ponceau S
- Verify primary antibody specificity
- Increase antibody concentration
- Extend exposure time

### High Background
- Increase washing steps
- Reduce antibody concentration
- Use fresh blocking solution
- Check for membrane drying

### Uneven Signal
- Ensure even transfer
- Check for air bubbles
- Verify even antibody coverage
- Maintain consistent temperature

## Safety Considerations
- Wear appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, eye protection)
- Handle acrylamide solutions with care
- Properly dispose of ECL waste
- Use caution with electrical equipment
