# Protocol for Protein Isolation from Biological Samples

## Materials Required
- Sample tissue or cells
- Ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100)
- Protease inhibitor cocktail
- Phosphatase inhibitors (if studying phosphoproteins)
- Microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 mL)
- Refrigerated centrifuge
- Homogenizer or sonicator
- Bradford reagent or other protein quantification method
- Micropipettes and tips
- Ice bucket
- Laboratory gloves and protective equipment

## Safety Precautions
1. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab coat, and eye protection
2. Handle all biological materials according to biosafety guidelines
3. Properly dispose of biohazardous waste
4. Use chemical hood when handling harmful reagents

## Procedure

### Sample Preparation
1. Place tissue sample or cell pellet on ice
2. If using tissue:
   - Cut into small pieces (2-3 mm)
   - Weigh approximately 100 mg of tissue
3. If using cells:
   - Harvest cells by centrifugation (300 x g, 5 minutes)
   - Wash cell pellet with ice-cold PBS

### Protein Extraction
1. Add ice-cold lysis buffer (1 mL per 100 mg tissue or 10⁷ cells)
2. Add protease inhibitor cocktail (follow manufacturer's instructions)
3. If studying phosphoproteins, add phosphatase inhibitors
4. For tissue samples:
   - Homogenize using mechanical homogenizer (3 x 10-second pulses)
   - Keep sample on ice between pulses
5. For cell samples:
   - Pipette up and down several times
   - Optional: Sonicate (3 x 5-second pulses at 20% amplitude)

### Clarification
1. Incubate lysate on ice for 30 minutes
2. Centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 15 minutes at 4°C
3. Carefully transfer supernatant to new tube
4. Keep sample on ice or store at -80°C

### Protein Quantification
1. Prepare Bradford standards using BSA (0-2 mg/mL)
2. Dilute protein sample 1:10 and 1:20 in water
3. Add Bradford reagent according to manufacturer's protocol
4. Measure absorbance at 595 nm
5. Calculate protein concentration using standard curve

## Quality Control
- Verify protein concentration is within expected range
- Check protein integrity by SDS-PAGE if needed
- Ensure consistent protein yields between samples

## Storage
- Store protein samples at -80°C in small aliquots
- Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles
- Label tubes with sample details and date

## Troubleshooting
- Low protein yield:
  - Check lysis buffer composition
  - Increase homogenization time
  - Verify sample handling and storage conditions
- Protein degradation:
  - Ensure all solutions are ice-cold
  - Verify protease inhibitor activity
  - Check sample storage conditions

## Notes
- All steps should be performed at 4°C or on ice unless specified
- Optimize lysis buffer composition for specific protein/tissue type
- Document any modifications to the protocol
- Validate protocol with known controls before processing valuable samples
