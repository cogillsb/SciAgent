# DNA Extraction Protocol

## Materials Required
- Sample material (tissue, cells, or blood)
- Lysis buffer (containing SDS and proteinase K)
- Phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1)
- RNase A (10 mg/mL)
- 100% and 70% ethanol
- TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0)
- Microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 mL)
- Micropipettes and tips
- Microcentrifuge
- Water bath or heating block
- Ice bucket
- Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, safety goggles)

## Safety Precautions
- Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment
- Handle phenol:chloroform under a fume hood
- Dispose of hazardous waste in designated containers
- Be aware of the location of safety equipment and emergency protocols

## Procedure

### 1. Sample Preparation
1. Place sample material (up to 25 mg tissue or 1x10⁶ cells) in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube
2. Add 500 µL lysis buffer containing proteinase K
3. Incubate at 56°C for 3 hours or overnight until completely lysed

### 2. RNA Removal
1. Add 5 µL RNase A (10 mg/mL)
2. Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes

### 3. Protein Removal
1. Add 500 µL phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol
2. Mix gently by inverting tube 10 times
3. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C
4. Carefully transfer upper aqueous phase to new tube
5. Repeat steps 1-4 if necessary for higher purity

### 4. DNA Precipitation
1. Add 2 volumes of cold 100% ethanol
2. Add 1/10 volume 3M sodium acetate (pH 5.2)
3. Mix gently by inverting
4. Incubate at -20°C for 1 hour or overnight
5. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 15 minutes at 4°C
6. Carefully remove supernatant

### 5. DNA Washing
1. Add 500 µL cold 70% ethanol
2. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C
3. Remove supernatant completely
4. Air dry pellet for 5-10 minutes

### 6. DNA Resuspension
1. Add 50-100 µL TE buffer
2. Incubate at 37°C for 15 minutes to aid dissolution
3. Store at 4°C for short term or -20°C for long term

## Quality Control
1. Measure DNA concentration using spectrophotometer
2. Check DNA purity by A260/A280 ratio (should be 1.8-2.0)
3. Verify DNA integrity by agarose gel electrophoresis

## Troubleshooting

### Low DNA Yield
- Insufficient sample material
- Incomplete lysis
- DNA loss during extraction
- Inefficient precipitation

### Poor DNA Quality
- Protein contamination
- RNA contamination
- Phenol carryover
- DNA degradation

## Notes
- Keep samples on ice when possible to prevent DNA degradation
- Use sterile equipment and solutions to prevent contamination
- For tough tissues, mechanical disruption may be necessary before lysis
- Avoid vortexing to prevent DNA shearing

## Expected Results
- DNA yield: 20-30 µg from 25 mg tissue
- A260/A280 ratio: 1.8-2.0
- Clear high molecular weight band on agarose gel
