# Southern Blot Protocol

## Materials Required

### Equipment
- Gel electrophoresis apparatus
- UV transilluminator
- Vacuum or capillary transfer system
- Hybridization oven
- Heat block or water bath
- Geiger counter (if using radioactive probes)

### Reagents
- Restriction enzymes
- Loading dye
- Agarose
- Ethidium bromide
- Denaturation solution (0.5 M NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl)
- Neutralization solution (0.5 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1.5 M NaCl)
- 20X SSC (3 M NaCl, 0.3 M sodium citrate)
- Nylon membrane
- Pre-hybridization buffer
- Labeled probe
- Washing buffers (2X SSC/0.1% SDS and 0.1X SSC/0.1% SDS)
- Detection reagents (specific to labeling method)

## Procedure

### Day 1: DNA Digestion and Gel Electrophoresis

1. Digest DNA samples:
   - Mix 5-10 µg genomic DNA with appropriate restriction enzyme(s)
   - Include reaction buffer and BSA if required
   - Incubate at recommended temperature for 2-4 hours
   - Heat inactivate enzyme at 65°C for 10 minutes

2. Prepare and run agarose gel:
   - Cast 0.8% agarose gel in 1X TAE buffer
   - Add ethidium bromide (0.5 µg/mL)
   - Load samples and DNA size markers
   - Run at 5 V/cm until bromophenol blue reaches 3/4 of gel length

3. Document gel:
   - Visualize DNA under UV light
   - Photograph gel with ruler alongside for size reference
   - Trim unnecessary parts of gel

### Day 2: Transfer

1. Prepare gel for transfer:
   - Depurinate: soak gel in 0.25 M HCl for 10 minutes
   - Denature: soak in denaturation solution for 30 minutes
   - Neutralize: soak in neutralization solution for 30 minutes
   - Rinse briefly with distilled water between steps

2. Set up transfer:
   - Cut nylon membrane to gel size plus 1 cm on each side
   - Pre-wet membrane in 2X SSC
   - Assemble transfer stack:
     * Paper towels (5-8 cm thick)
     * 3 pieces of Whatman paper
     * Nylon membrane
     * Gel (wells facing down)
     * 3 pieces of Whatman paper
     * Long piece of Whatman paper as bridge
     * Reservoir of 20X SSC
   - Add weight on top
   - Transfer overnight (12-16 hours)

### Day 3: Hybridization and Detection

1. Fix DNA to membrane:
   - Remove membrane carefully
   - Mark wells and orientation
   - UV crosslink (120 mJ/cm²) or bake at 80°C for 2 hours

2. Pre-hybridization:
   - Place membrane in hybridization tube
   - Add pre-hybridization buffer
   - Incubate at 65°C for 1-2 hours

3. Hybridization:
   - Denature probe (95°C for 5 minutes)
   - Add to pre-hybridization buffer
   - Hybridize overnight at 65°C

### Day 4: Washing and Detection

1. Wash membrane:
   - 2X SSC/0.1% SDS at room temperature, 15 minutes, twice
   - 0.1X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65°C, 15 minutes, twice

2. Detection:
   - Follow specific protocol based on probe labeling method
   - For radioactive probes: expose to X-ray film
   - For non-radioactive probes: follow manufacturer's detection protocol

## Notes and Troubleshooting

- Always wear appropriate PPE, especially when handling ethidium bromide
- Use RNase-free reagents if RNA contamination is a concern
- Ensure complete restriction digestion for clear results
- Monitor transfer efficiency by checking gel after transfer
- Include positive and negative controls
- For weak signals:
  * Increase DNA amount
  * Extend exposure time
  * Optimize hybridization conditions
- For high background:
  * Increase stringency of washes
  * Reduce probe concentration
  * Check membrane blocking

## Expected Timeline
- Day 1: DNA digestion and gel electrophoresis (4-6 hours)
- Day 2: Transfer setup and overnight transfer (1 hour setup + overnight)
- Day 3: Hybridization setup (2 hours + overnight)
- Day 4: Washing and detection (2-4 hours)
